                            <p>On behalf of the Organizing Committee, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to the APKASS 2026 conference, held in conjunction with the 2026 Annual International Congress of the Korean Arthroscopy Society (APKASS 2026 Korea & ICKAS 2026), co-hosted by Asia-Pacific Knee, Arthroscopy, Arthroplasty, Shoulder, and Sports Medicine Society and the Korean Arthroscopy Society. This event is particularly special as it marks the first time the APKASS Congress is being held in South Korea. </p>
                            <p>The theme of this year, <strong class="italic">'From Asia-Pacific Heritage to Global Horizons’</strong>, reflects our commitment to advancing joint surgery and sports medicine worldwide, fostering collaboration and sharing cutting-edge research across various disciplines.</p>
                            <p>In line with this vision, the APKASS 2026 will feature a diverse range of sessions, including joint-specific discussions on Knee, Shoulder, Hip & Pelvis, Foot & Ankle, Wrist & Elbow, and Spine. Attendees can expect in-depth insights into orthopedic research, encompassing arthroscopy, arthroplasty, and sports medicine. The scientific program will include Plenary and Keynote Lectures, ICL Sessions, Free Paper Presentations, and Poster Exhibitions, providing plentiful opportunities for knowledge exchange. This year marks our inaugural Live Surgery Symposium, and we will also hold combined sessions with international organizations such as ISAKOS, SLARD, ASSOM, ESSKA, AFSM, and ICRS facilitating collaboration with global experts. </p>
                            <p>As you participate in the APKASS 2026, we encourage you to experience the beauty of Incheon and the stunning autumn weather of Korea. The convention venue, located by the sea, offers an ideal setting for both academic discussions and relaxation.</p>
